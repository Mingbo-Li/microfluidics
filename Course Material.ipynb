    "# Microfluidics Course\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the new semester. We start with an introduction of what fluids (gases and liquids) are and set the foundation for the first part of the course on *microfluidics*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lecture 1: General Introduction (2.4.2019)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the adminstration and give a introduction into fluid mechanics and microfluidics in particular. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gases and liquids can be modeled with particles (non interacting and interacting). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations help to understand their behaviour and watch them in slow motion. To get into the mood of using averaged equations I want you to play with a MD program. It can be [run in your browser](http://cav2012.sg/cdohl/ph3501/md/). For more information on how to run the program is available  [web site from Prof Schroeder](http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/md/), please note that his version does not have the pressure graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get us all started, we rehearse some math. Please look and work through the [Math refresher notebook](01 Math Refresher and Python Introduction.ipynb). This notebook also offers you with some first introduction into Python, the language we use in the course. A nice [introduction is given by Robert Johansson](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-1-Introduction-to-Python-Programming.ipynb). Don't worry, we will slowly start with it. I'll motivate the use of a programming language in the course, and besides learning fluid mechanics you obtain some skills which increases your employability!\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a short recap on the \n",
    "* [math](01 Math Refresher and Python Introduction.ipynb) and the representation in Python\n",
    "then we'll look into the\n",
    "* Ch1 [streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines](02 Streamlines, Pathlines, Streaklines.ipynb) and use a [interactive example](Example of Stream-Streak-Pathlines.ipynb) before we look at the \n",
    "* Ch2 [material derivative](Material Derivative, Gaussian Divergence Theorem and Conservation of Mass.ipynb)\n",

    "\n",
    "Math recap and discuss the microfluidic papers and videos to get a feeling of what microfluidics is about. The paper will be handed out in the second lecture and be prepared for the second tutorial in week 3\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information at hand you should be able to answer the questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  What are common methods to build microfluidic channel?\n",
    "*  What are the physical properties of PDMS? Is it hydrophilic?\n",
    "*  How is liquid filled into microchannels?\n",

    "[Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8zE2i755-k), [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68p3qAm4i7U), and [Video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYuyRUjnTgc).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Lecture 3: NS and Analytical Solutions (steady)\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Navier Stokes Equation](Cauchy's Equation of Motion & Navier Stokes Equation.ipynb) are derived from the Cauchy's Equation of Motion using a linear fluid. Simple Solutions to the Navier Stokes Equations [planar and cylindrical symmetry](Analytical solutions to steady and laminar flows.ipynb) are derived.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lecture 4: Analytical Solution (steady and unsteady)\n",
    "\n",
    "First we continue with the solution of the flow in a [tube and cylinder](Analytical solutions to steady and laminar flows.ipynb). Then we discuss the [accelerated plate problem](Analytical solution for an unsteady flow.ipynb) resulting in a diffusion equation and its solution using a similarity ansatz. If time permits I would like to introduce the non-dimenisonal NS equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Lecture 5: Analytical Solutions 2, Hele-Shaw Cell, and potential flow\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to a flow in [rectangular channel](Analytical solutions to steady and laminar flows.ipynb) is derived. Then we look at flow in a thin gaped channel, the [Hele-Shaw cell](Hele Shaw Flow.ipynb). Interestingly the solution to this flow is a [potential flow](Ideal Flow & Solutions to the Laplace Equation.ipynb) in the lateral direction. The potential flow equation can be derived from an irrotational (inviscid) and incompressible flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial 2: Potential Flow and introduction to CFD \n",
    "\n",
    "We solve [numerically the potential flow](Solving the Laplace Equation numerically.ipynb) equation for an extensional flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lecture 6: Bernoulli (steady and time dependent)\n",
    "We derive the general [Bernoulli Equation](Bernoulli Equation.ipynb) for a compressible, unsteady, inviscid and rotational flow. For an ideal flow (inviscid and incompressible) the Bernoulli equation simplifies. Two examples are discussed: a steady [flow around a sphere](Potential Sphere.ipynb) and an unsteady flow of a [closing void](Rayleigh_ODE.ipynb).\n",
